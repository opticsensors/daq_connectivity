# `daq_connectivity`
This repository is used for easily acquire serial data via USB for DATAQ Instruments products. Two methods are supported: ascii and binary.

The code is based on [this repo](https://github.com/dataq-instruments/Simple-Python-Examples). It essentially converts an analog input (voltage) to a digital value. 

## Examples of use:
